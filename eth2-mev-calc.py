# # Analysis of MEV rewards in ETH2
# 
# This analysis is executed alongside the [post] we've released on MEV in eth2.
# 
# We re-use the code from [this article](https://pintail.xyz/posts/beacon-chain-validator-rewards/) by Pintail, adding additional considerations for MEV rewards using Flashbots data as a proxy for it. The Flashbots data we use has been collected by running an MEV-Geth node and querying the public [mev-blocks API](https://blocks.flashbots.net).

# At the current level of validators (~150k), we find that MEV can increase validator rewards by 67%, or give an implied yield of 12.52% rather than non-MEV yield of 7.59%. 

# ### ideal case on 1y timescale
# Over any finite timescale, there will be variability in rewards, since some validators will be lucky and be given the opportunity to propose a greater than average number of blocks, and some unlucky, proposing fewer. We can find the distribution of luck for block proposal frequency in a year using the binomial distribution formula:
# - every validator has an equal chance of being selected to propose each slot
#     - if there are 100,000 validators then the chance of being selected to propose a slot is $10^{-5}$
# - there are $\ 31556952 / 12 = 2629746$ slots per year. 
# 
# For 100,000 validators, this give us $$P(X) = {{2629746}\choose{k}} \cdot (10^{-5})^k{(1-10^{-5})}^{2629746-k}$$

# ### Adding a diferent dimension to luck: accounting for variation in REV

# The above only considers luck in the sense of being assigned the opportunity of producing blocks. We know however that there is also a wide variation in the amount of Realized Extractable Value going to the miner in the different blocks. We account for that variation by considering the distribution of miner REV (only Flashbots bundles for ~100k blocks) jointly with the block producing one. 
# 
# As these are independent, we can redefine the "luckiest 1%" to be the intersection (product) of the luckiest 10% in the block producing sense with that of the luckiest 10% in the miner REV sense. Note that this is a coarse metric simply taking the 10/90 quantiles of the REV distribution (as opposed to sampling from the tails), so only gives a rough approximation of the REV-induced variation, particularly considering that the distribution is long-tailed (see below).

# ### Adding in slashing constraints: perfect validator on an imperfect network 
# 
# Now that we've modelled the above, we can look into versions of the model that factor in slashing constraints. The first situation to model is a perfect validator on an imperfect network. Validators get slashed not only for their own behavior but for the behaviour of others. Even if a validator behaves perfectly, other's behaviour may influence their reward. In particular, Pintail outlines two reasons perfect validators can get slashed:
# - the accuracy reward is scaled by the proportion of active validators who voted the same way
# - if an attestation of the perfect validator is included late because the block producer for the slot is offline, then the inclusion reward declines in inverse proportion to the inclusion delay.
#

# ### adding in slashing constraints: imperfect validator on a perfect network
# 
# Now looking at an imperfect validator on a perfect network (ie. where our validator is the only one who goes offline), we can model how being offline affects a validator's revenue. Being offline causes 1) missing out some rewards, 2) penalties for missed attestations. Again, using Pintail's model we can find the minimum online time required in a year to receive a positive net reward.

#Skewed under 0 because we take average # of blocks proposed, need to repeat for luckiest/unluckiest 1%


# The minimum uptime figure we find is now at about 27%, significantly lower than 43%. 

# ### summary of analysis
# 
# At the current number of ETH staked on the beacon chain ~4.8m:
# 1. validators stand to make an additional X eth per year from MEV revenue, or a XX% increase in average expected rewards, equivalent to an MEV-enabled XX% average annual staying yield vs ZZ% without MEV.
# 2. MEV rewards increase the inequality between luckiest and unluckiest validators, where luck is defined as both block-proposal luck and MEV luck.
# 3. MEV rewards imply a level of participation X% lower for the same returns as non-MEV rewards.
# 4. MEV rewards imply a minimum participation rate of ZZ% in order to breakeven, lower than the 43% found by Pintail. 

# #### future model improvements & caveats
# - accounting for transaction fees using EIP-1559 numbers once it's live
# - factoring in fee burn as being generally accretive to all ETH holders (including validators)
# - factoring in more complex distributions
#
