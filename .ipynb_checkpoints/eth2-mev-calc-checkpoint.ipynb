    "It's a useful thought exercise to think through the additional MEV rewards validators would get on top of their staking yield were they to run modified eth1 client software like Flashbots' MEV-Geth. Re-using the code from [this article](https://pintail.xyz/posts/beacon-chain-validator-rewards/) by Pintail, we can add additional considerations for MEV rewards using Flashbots data as a proxy for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations have been added at the bottom here and stem from data collected by running an MEV-Geth node and analyzing Flashbots data from the public [mev-blocks API](https://blocks.flashbots.net)."
